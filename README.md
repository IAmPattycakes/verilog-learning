# verilog-learning

Just a repo of dumb little modules I'm making to just learn how to do stuff in Verilog. Everything is designed to work on the webFPGA shasta board because it's easy to set up and I can test the synthesis without installing stuff on my work laptop. 

You can probably find everything way better either on here or opencores. But I'm learning.
